What I like: I love how version control provides a safety net, allowing me to track every change and revert to previous versions if something goes wrong, making collaboration and experimentation stress-free.

What I find most challenging: The most frustrating part is dealing with merge conflicts they can be time-consuming and nerve-wracking to resolve them correctly without accidentally discarding important updates.
